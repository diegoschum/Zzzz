If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",

    "We are exploring what factor infulence higher ratings for video games on IMDB. This is a regression problem with the goal of prediciting IMDb ratings. This is a prediction problem for video games without ratings. We will optimize our RSME to measure the fit of our model because it penalizes larger errors more severely. In order to accomplish this, several techniques will be implemented such as variable selection and variable transformation. We might also utilize stepwise regression, since we predict storng correlations between the relevant variables. However, we will remain felxible in our techniques based on the different analyses we get at different steps."
